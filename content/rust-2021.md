# Target Support
I want to see AVR support be pushed to stable, so I can do some side projects!
Why?  Because as a college student up to this point I have received 5 free
arduinos (2 megas, 2 unos and a pololu-raspberry pi hat thing that is
arduino-compatible), and I would like to use them as a way to get into more
embedded development in Rust.

# Compile Times And Bloat
Micro-optimization is great, but I think there's something that could lead to an
even bigger speedup.  The way Cargo works currently, dependencies must be
compiled before the program that needs them.  But, I propose that eventually
this depth-first dependency traversal gets replaced with a breadth-first
traversal.  Here's an example:

**foo lib.rs**:
```rust
pub fn bar() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

pub fn baz() {
    println!("¡Hola, mundo!");
}
```

**demo main.rs**:
```rust
fn main() {
    foo::bar();
}
```

Currently, the way the Rust compiler works, it will always compile `baz()`.
Obviously, it doesn't need to in order to create a working program.  `baz()`
could possibly be using the slowest-to-compile features of Rust, or could in
turn include thousands of lines of code and constant data.

Instead, the way I think this should work, is while the `demo` crate is
compiling, cargo/rustc keeps track of which items are used.  Then, rustc only
compiles `bar()` when building the `foo` crate, and ignores `baz()` completely.
This not only would possibly improve compile times, but also make bloat almost a
non-problem.  Additionally, this has the potentential to eliminate long linking
times (which are slowest part of incremental compiles) since items are linked as
they are used.

I wouldn't expect this to be in the 2021 edition, but I think the current way
rustc and cargo work, this would be impossible (and possibly involve edition
breaking changes, which is why I'm mentioning it here).

# Match Statements
Match statements are my favorite feature of Rust (by far).  Doesn't mean they
can't be improved though.  Take the following example:

```rust
enum KeyboardKey {
    Escape,
    F1,
    F2,
    F3,
    // …
}

use KeyboardKey::*;
match key {
    F1 => { /* … */ }
    F2 => { /* … */ }
    F3 => { /* … */ }
    Escap => { /* … */ }
    _ => { /* … */ }
}
```

It drives me crazy that this compiles.  I make this mistake all of the time.  I
know it shows a camel case warning, but if you're at a point in the development
process where you too many warnings to look through, it's hard to pinpoint why
your code doesn't work.  And, looking at it, it may not be clear what the issue
is.

Instead, an edition-breaking-change should be made eventually:

```
/* … */

use KeyboardKey::*;
match key {
    F1 => { /* … */ }
    F2 => { /* … */ }
    F3 => { /* … */ }
    Escap => { /* … */ }
    let _ => { /* … */ }
}
```

Now there is a syntactical difference between the second-to-last and last match
arms.  This makes it easy for the compiler to throw an error when the code is
wrong, and I'd argue it's easier to read.  I think this change should follow the
same path as the `dyn` keyword.  Not using `dyn` is deprecated in the 2018
edition, and I hope it will turn into an error in the 2021 edition.  Not using
`let` in this situation should be deprecated in the 2021 edition and turned into
an error in the 2024 edition.  Semantic differences like this should have their
own syntax, and I think this follows the same mentality set by `if let`
statements.  A more complicated example might be:

```rust
let a = vec![/* … */];
match a {
    let x if x.is_empty() => { /* … */ }
    let x if x.len() <= 4 => { /* … */ }
    5 => { /* … */ }
    7 => { /* … */ }
    let six_or_more_than_seven => { /* … */ }
}
```

And this (which clarifies the most confusing thing about match statements):

```
// Only possible once `let` is required.
let var = 5;
match 4 {
    var => unreachable!(),
    let var => { /* … */ }
}
```

## Bonus
I would also appreciate not having to add use statements immediately above all
my match statements.  But, I consider what I've outlined above more important to
actually solving a real problem with match statements.

```rust
enum Enum {
    A,
    B,
}

let var: Enum = /* … */;

match var {
    A => { /* … */ }
    B => { /* … */ }
}
```

# Features
Features is a poorly named feature.  But that's the least of it's problems.
There is no standard way to document features.  General good practice now is to
make sure your features are additive, but it's not enforced at all.  Generally,
they are also undiscoverable - they don't show up on crates.io or docs.rs.
Usually, I have to go to a crates source code and read their ugly and long
Cargo.toml to see what is even an option, and than guess as to what it does.

I think features should be deprecated.  They only have two uses: reduce compile
time, and choose an implementation.  The reducing compile time thing is fixed by
what I wrote earlier in the [Compile Times And Bloat](#Compile_Times_And_Bloat)
section.  Choosing an implementation is interesting here, because features are
additive, so they're kind of abused into an almost C-style enum.  Additionally,
different crates can request incompatible features (even when additive, because
which implementation should be compiled?). I propose that instead, we have a
choice mechanism.

**lib.rs**:

```rust
/// Choose either iterative or recursive implementation.
#[choice]
static enum ALGORITHM_CHOICE: AlgorithmChoice {
    /// Solve recursively
    Recursive,
    /// Solve iteratively
    Iterative,
}

/// Greatest Common Divisor.
pub fn gcd(mut a: u32, mut b: u32) -> u32 {
    match ALGORITHM_CHOICE {
        AlgorithmChoice::Recursive => {
            if a == 0 { 
                return b;
            } else if b == 0 {
                return a;
            }
            let new_b = a % b;
            a = b;
            if new_b == 0 {
                a
            } else {
                gcd(a, new_b)
            }
        }
        AlgorithmChoice::Iterative => {
            if a == 0 {
                return b;
            } else if b == 0 {
                return a;
            }
            loop {
                a %= b;
                if a == 0 {
                    return b;
                }
                b %= a;
                if b == 0 {
                    return a;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This would show up on docs.rs in it's own section.  And if the crate is included
in the dependency tree more than once with different choices, then it should
compile the function separately for each choice - that way crates can't
interfere with other crate's dependencies as a sibling node in the dependency
tree (which they currently can with features).

# Async Closures
I would like to be able to pass async closures as literal parameters.

```rust
some_function(async |/* … */| { /* … */ });
```

# Standard SIMD
The standard library should include safe types like `u32x4` that work on all
supported architectures.

# Const Generics
It would be nice to be able to provide an API as I've wanted to do before:

```rust
StackVec<4, T>::new();
```

# Crates.io
I think crates.io should borrow some cool features from lib.rs.  Although, I
think the most popular libraries may not always be what's best for your specific
use case (as lib.rs implies).  I think it would make life easier for all Rust
programmers if there was a page on crates.io that helps you find what dependency
you need.  I don't think I have the answer on how to accomplish this, but I
think even a graphical form of
[awesome-rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) on the home
page of crates.io would be a huge improvement.

# Error Handling
I don't think this is much of a problem in it's current state, and I know
there's some talk about adding some syntactic sugar.  But, we could probably all
be fine with a macro in the `core` library:

```rust
sum!(NewError, ErrorA, ErrorB);
sum!(CombinedError, NewError, ErrorC);
```

where all types are `enum`s.  Expanding to something like:

```
#[sum]
enum NewError {
    ErrorA(ErrorA),
    ErrorB(ErrorB),
}

#[sum]
enum CombinedError {
    ErrorA(ErrorA),
    ErrorB(ErrorB),
    ErrorC(ErrorC),
}
```

This would likely be a fancy proc macro, using the `#[sum]` attribute to allow
un-nesting functionality.  This is the only thing I feel I've been missing from
error handling in Rust, but I might be alone on this one.  Other proposals I've
seen have been quite complicated, and I think the language is complicated enough
already.

# `#[macro_use]`
`#[macro_use]` should be completely removed from the language.  Macros should
follow the exact same import scheme as other public items.  It's too confusing
having multiple ways to do it, and it's obvious that Rust is moving in this
direction, so let's get it over with!

# `as`
The `as` keyword should be completely removed from the language.  Enums without
associated data, and assigned numeric values should automatically implement
`Into` and `TryFrom` for their `repr` types.  This would make dealing with enums
insanely easier in many situations.

# Single-threaded executor
The standard library should include a function to simply run a future on the
current thread.  I wrote something similar for my
[pasts](https://docs.rs/pasts/0.4.0/src/pasts/cvar_exec.rs.html) crate.

# Non-Lexical-Lifetimes
When NLL got introduced, I thought it would fix ever having to create a scope to
guarantee to the compiler that I can borrow something later.  Turns out in very
complex code it is still a problem (somewhere in the hundreds of thousands of
lines of Rust code I have written, and unfortunately can't find at the moment).
Not that it's common or anything, but there are corner cases where it doesn't do
what I had hoped.  I'll update this post when I find an example.

# Conclusion
I don't think it's necessary to get all of these things out for Rust 2021, but I
think for edition-breaking-changes should be made to allow these to be added in
minor version updates in the future.  Thanks for reading!
