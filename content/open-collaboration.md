There is this concept of open collaboration, which with the invention of open source software, has entered into other fields.  This research aims to find out how students at Augsburg University feel about open collaboration and it's spread into the economy.

Although there has been a lot of research in the topic of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>, the general public may not understand it very well.  I want to know how well students at Augsburg University understand about it, and how they feel about it.  In order to understand <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>, we need an example.  One of the more commonly referred to examples of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>
is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b>.  So what is it?  For something to be considered <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> it must have source code, it must not restrict the distribution of the software, it must allow modifications and derived works under the same license as the original work, it must not discrimate against anyone or any groups of people or fields of work and, it cannot restrict other software <i>(Kierkegaard, P., & Adrian, A.; 2010)</i>.  What does this mean in English?  Basically, you give the people rights to modify and distribute the code that you wrote.  <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">Free Software</a></b> is a related concept - while the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> movement stresses the importance of nonowned software, the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">Free Software</a></b> movement is a movement focuses more on the ethics of open code, and to keep it from being sold if borrowed for proprietary software <i>(HERTELIU, E. E.; 2010)</i>.</p><p style="text-align:left">  Another example of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> is the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY Movement</a></b>  (DIY stands for Do-It-Yourself) <i>(Aitamurto, T., Holland, D., & Hussain, S.; 2015)</i>.  The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY Movement</a></b> is centralized around community cooperation, and rejection of the heirarchy; it is opposed to capitalism and came into existence in a similar way to Hippies and Punk Rock<i>(Hemphill, D., & Leskowitz, S.; 2013)</i>.</p><p style="text-align:left">  A third example of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wikis</a></b>.  Wiki communities work by having Trust within a community and "shar[ing] knowledge interactively" <i>(Wang, W., & Wei, Z.; 2011)</i>.  </p><p style="text-align:left"> Some other examples of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> movements are <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">Open Access</a></b> - scientific data made open, no copyright restrictions <i>(HERTELIU, E. E.; 2010)</i>, and the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">Creative Commons</a></b> organization <i>(Sullivan, J. L.; 2011)</i>.</p>

<h3>But why care about <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>?</h3> <p style="text-align:left"> <a title="By Open Source Initiative official SVG (Simon Phipps, former president of OSI) [CC BY 2.5 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Opensource.svg"><img width="200pt" alt="Opensource" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Opensource.svg/256px-Opensource.svg.png" style="position:relative;float:left;margin-right:15px"></a><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> and open collaboration are becoming more common <i>(GITTLEN, S.; 2016)</i>.  In fact the
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> paradigm is spreading, and forming a new open hardware
design community <i>(Aitamurto, T., Holland, D., & Hussain, S.; 2015)</i>.  We
care about this shift because it can be thought of as opposed to
captialism.  Or, it could actually act as an economical structure - a
modification on capitalism in order to make it more fair
<i>(Marthaller, J.; 2017)</i>.  Even film animators are adopting some open
collaboration practices <i>(Velkova, J., & Jakobsson, P.; 2017)</i>.  It's even
been suggested to use <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> to keep track of countries
ownership of weapons of mass destruction, in order to get to world peace
<i>(Jeremias, G., & Himmel, M.; 2016)</i>.  In 2021, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> jobs are
predicted to take over many IT jobs, which are traditionally proprietary
software jobs; A normal future computer science job might very well be
working on <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> software <i>(GITTLEN, S.; 2016)</i>.
</p><p style="text-align:left">
In this research study, I've decided to ask Augsburg University students
whether or not they have heard of various forms of Open Collaboration,
and what their opinions are on them.  I've decided to ask university
students because the future of open collaboration is likely decided by
people who are a few years away from entering the workforce.  How they
feel about how this is going to affect their careers, is going to affect
their opinions, and therefore open collaboration's future (We care
about it's future because of the above paragraph).

<h3>Arguments against and for <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b></h3>
<p style="text-align:left">

To counter the spread of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> there has been some
hesitation to adopt it for different reasons.  Both IBM and Microsoft
worried about competition with <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> software <i>(Gruen, N.; 2005)</i>.
There is a large fear that programmers will not be able to be payed if
the company can't sell the software to make money.  The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b>
movement, by some is thought to be a threat to proprietary software
markets; Linux mostly has taken over the server market <i>(Xing, M.; 2015)</i>.
Windows and other proprietary servers are rare to come by, because Linux
works just fine for the task; Just about no one buys an operating system
to run their server.
Others have a more practical than ethical problem with <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b>.  
Their argument against <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> is that in the case of a software
project like OpenSSL (code that handles basically all security), the
software is not being funded very well - the code base is a mess, and
bugs like heartbleed have been introduced that could have been caught if
people were being payed to look over the software, and maintain
good-quality <i>(KAMP, P.; 2014)</i>.
</p><p style="text-align:left">
IBM and Microsoft have recently abandoned their view that <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> is
a threat.  <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> is actually working within our current economy.
In fact, 90% of Linux patches come from tech companies; this
means a lot of people are being payed to work on <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> software
<i>(Gruen, N.; 2005)</i>.  Even Microsoft and IBM are now working on open
source software <i>(GITTLEN, S.; 2016)</i>.  <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> and <b>Open
Collaboration</b> in economic
practice can actually allow for commercialization and financial gain,
without requiring anyone to actually own the product <i>(Georgopoulou, P.;
2009)</i>.  Through a combination of donations, sponsors and employees at
tech companies, the people who make the software can make money.  And,
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> Software actually "favors market expansion
more than proprietary software does by tapping into spontaneous work
input" through an "open division of labor" <i>(Garzarelli, G., Limam, Y.
R., & Thomassen, B.; 2008)</i>.  It is also said that technological and
cultural freedom can increase from <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> movements
<i>(Sullivan, J. L.; 2011)</i>, and that it could allow for a "moral economy"
<i>(Velkova, J., & Jakobsson, P.; 2017)</i>.  Often times <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b>
software
users tend to be more involved in the development of the software than
proprietary software users, so issues are reported and found if not
fixed by the user in a shorter period than proprietary software
<i>(Garzarelli, G., Limam, Y. R., & Thomassen, B.; 2008)</i>.

## Method
In order to figure out how Augsburg Students feel about open
collaboration, I have made a Google Forms and emailed it out to people.
17 people took the survey (4 within the computer science department,
and 13 outside of it).  The charts were made with Libre Office.  Survey takers were asked whether or not they are in the computer science department.  We can
compare their results (computer science vs. non-computer science
students).

## Results and Discussion
Are you familiar with the concept of [**Open Collaboration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration)?
<p style="text-align:left">

</p>
<p style="text-align:left">As expected, computer science students are
more familiar with <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> than non-computer science
students, likely due to the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> movement.  But still, half of
computer science students still don't know what it is.  And people
outside of the computer science department may have heard of it, but no
one who took the survey was familiar with the concept.  Seemingly, the
phrase "<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>" is not commonly known at Augsburg.
</p>
<h3>Are you familiar with the concept of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b>?</h3>

<p style="text-align:left">
Again, the computer science students have more knowledge on the concept.
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> is a more widely understood concept than <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>.
Still, half of the students have not heard of it.
</p>
<h3>Do you....</h3>

</p>
<p style="text-align:left">
In the computer science department, if you use <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b> then you tend
to also be a contributor.  Most people said that they don't use open
source - but this could be because half the people are not familiar with
the concept (They could be using it, but not realise).  About a quarter
of Augsburg students who took the survey use <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a></b>.

<h3><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY Movement</a></b></h3>

</p>
<p style="text-align:left">
It looks like about half of Augsburg students who took the survey are
familiar with the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY Movement</a></b>.  Only a few are actively involved
though.  Familiarity with the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY Movement</a></b> doesn't seem to depend much
on whether or not the student is in the computer science department.
</p>
<h3><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wikis</a></b> (websites like Wikipedia)</h3>
<p style="text-align:left">

</p>
<p style="text-align:left">
Wiki usage/contributions also doesn't depend on whether or not the
student is in the computer science department or not.  About 1/8 of
Augsburg students who took the survey contribute to <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wikis</a></b>, which is a
relatively large amount of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> involvement in the

<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">Open Access</a></b> usage also doesn't depend on whether or not the

Computer science students seem more unsure about about <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>
being a good force in the world than non-computer science
students.  This could be because they are worried that it will take
their jobs, or that it will lessen the quality of their work.  No one

unsure.

The wide majority of Augsburg students at least partially identify
themselves as socialist.  No one describes themselves as completely
socialist, though, which explains why most respondents were unsure about

Computer Science students seem to be more concerned about the open
source negatively affecting the economy (they're likely worried about
the future of the computer science industry).  Non-computer science
students are not concerned - this is likely because a lot of them don't

This question has the clearest divide between computer science students
and non-computer science students.  Computer scientists seem to not see
a difference between desktop and mobile applications.  Everyone else
seems to shift more towards desktop open sourcing being more justified.
This is likely because desktop applications are usually needed more by
the user.  I have a lot of games on my phone - which are just for fun,
while the programs on my computer I often use for homework and projects,
and are more necessary for what I do as a computer scientist and
student.  And, no one wants to buy something proprietary just to do
homework or their job - they'd rather spend money on something fun.

Unlike I thought, before conducting this survey, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b> is
NOT more common among computer science students.  In fact, they seem to
be more skeptical about it than the average Augsburg student.  But,
they certainly know more about it.  Nevertheless, the computer science
community is shifting towards it (and other industries too), whether we
like it or not.  But it doesn't look like people have a strong opinion
yet, since none of the survey-takers are convinced that open
collaboration is bad, and none of them think it will negatively affect
the economy.
</p>
<p style="text-align:left">
But why be so skeptical of open collaboration?  The
research that I have done seems to point out that it works very well.  I
think that people don't know enough about open collaboration.  Survey-takers
overwhelmingly reported not having heard of it before, and just about
all of them have used some form of it.

With the coming rise of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration">Open Collaboration</a></b>,
people need to have a better understanding of what it is, and how it
affects life.  In the future, we may see economic laws passed, and more
companies adopting the practice of open collaboration.  Current college
students may get hired for open collaboration.  These are all reasons
why I think that it is important for college students to understand the
concept.  But, despite the research, we have yet to see it's full
potential - and it's weaknesses - which is even more reason
for the public to try to understand it.
