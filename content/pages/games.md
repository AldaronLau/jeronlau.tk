## Plop Grizzly
Jeron Lau is the project lead, composer, and head programmer for
[Plop Grizzly](https://plopgrizzly.com/plopgrizzly/); a phone game where bears
take over the beach and are kicked out by the local militia. Aliens on the moon
give them the Power of Plop, and they transform into the second species of
[drop bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_bear): The Plop Grizzly. Now, plop on the militia and anyone else you don't like!
