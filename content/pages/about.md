# About
Jeron Lau [makes software](https://github.com/Nezeky) and
[composes/produces music](https://nezeky.bandcamp.com/).  He's always up for
collaboration on either, which would explain the large number of open source
projects he's authored.  His favorite programming language is
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and favorite genre of music is
[Synthpop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synth-pop).  He likes to combine his
passions, and is working on a synthesizer trombone mute.  Jeron Lau believes
that building cross-platform user-space applications should be as easy as
developing for an embedded system, which led him to start the
[Cala Project](https://github.com/libcala/), a collection of portable Rust
software libraries for interfacing with personal computer and mobile phone
hardware.  Jeron Lau also plays trombone and makes
[short films](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpi3-bUNmmsJ0djuL38lmA).
