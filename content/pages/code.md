## [The Cala Project](https://github.com/libcala)

### Cross-platform system interface for hardware IO
The Cala Project is a collection of platform agnostic [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) crates for
interfacing with computer hardware from a
[user space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space) application.  The goal is
to make a pure-Rust alternative to both [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/),
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/), and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

### About The [Cala](https://crates.io/crates/cala) Crate
Easily create cross-platform applications. Some common tasks are not easily
portable across different platforms, and this crate hopes to fix that. That way
you don't have to worry about how to port your GUI, audio, or bluetooth
interface, etc. and can get straight to building your application's content!

Cala is a platform-agnostic system interface for hardware IO. This means that
eventually, Cala should support all of the different hardware that's connected
to your computer. Cala is designed so that it talks to the operating system to
interface with the hardware, so no special permissions are needed for your
application.

### [Muon Data Format](https://github.com/muon-data)
MuON is a text format for data serialization. It is suitable for configuration files and data interchange â€” as expressive as other formats, but much simpler.
